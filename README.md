# Frontend Mentor - Tic Tac Toe Solution

This is my solution to the [Tic Tac Toe challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tic-tac-toe-game-Re7ZF_E2v). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Play the game either solo vs. the computer or multiplayer against another person.
- Close or refresh the browser and come back to finish the game because the game state is preserved.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I Learned

In this project, I needed to manage many different states simultaneously and, thus, gained more perspective and appreciation for Redux. However, at the beginning, I decided to use only the `useState` hook and stuck with that decision until the end. It was challenging, but I think I will use Redux next time.

Another thing I learned from this project is the minimax algorithm, which is the algorithm that makes the CPU "smarter." Basically, it uses recursion to calculate the winning probability of all scenarios and returns the best one.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on Redux and other paradigms of state management. I will likely try to work a little bit on the backend.
